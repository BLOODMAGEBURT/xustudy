### 环境变量 .env， python-dotenv

> As you have seen as I built this application, there are a number of configuration options that depend on having variables set up in your environment before you start the server. This includes your secret key, email server information, database URL, and Microsoft Translator API key. You'll probably agree with me that this is inconvenient, because each time you open a new terminal session those variables need to be set again.

#### 使用步骤

1. 安装`python-dotenv`

   `pip install python-dotenv`

2. 创建`.env`文件，并且**不要**加入到git版本控制中

   内容格式为 A = A

   例如：

   ```python
   SECRET_KEY=a-really-long-and-unique-key-that-nobody-knows
   MAIL_SERVER=localhost
   MAIL_PORT=25
   MS_TRANSLATOR_KEY=<your-translator-key-here>
   ```

3. 在`config.py`文件中配置.env

   ```python
   from dotenv import load_dotenv
   # 加载根目录的.env文件
   basedir = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__))
   load_dotenv(os.path.join(basedir, '.env'))
   ```
